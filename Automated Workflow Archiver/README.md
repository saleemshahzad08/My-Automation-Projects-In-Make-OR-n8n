# Automated Workflow Archiver

## Overview

The **Automated Workflow Archiver** is an automated process designed to extract, analyze, and archive workflow data and documentation for Google Forms-based applications. It collects responses from a specific Google Form, processes any uploaded workflow JSON files, generates a descriptive README, and archives both the original JSON and the generated README into a designated GitHub repository.

---

## Purpose

- **Collect:** Monitor and collect new responses from a Google Form where users upload workflow JSON files.
- **Process:** Analyze uploaded workflow JSONs and extract relevant metadata.
- **Document:** Automatically generate a human-readable README summarizing each workflow.
- **Archive:** Upload both the original workflow JSON file (`blueprint.json`) and its autogenerated documentation (`README.md`) to a specified GitHub repository for centralized archiving and easy access.

---

## Workflow Steps

1. **Watch Google Form Responses:**  
   The workflow listens for new submissions from a specified Google Form. Each submission is expected to include a file upload—typically a workflow’s JSON file.

2. **Retrieve Uploaded File(s) (Google Drive):**  
   For each file uploaded via the form, the workflow fetches the actual JSON file from Google Drive.

3. **Analyze the Workflow (OpenAI GPT):**  
   The workflow utilizes the OpenAI GPT model to read and analyze the JSON file, generating a concise, human-readable README that summarizes the workflow’s purpose, inputs, and outputs.

4. **Archive to GitHub:**
   - **Upload README.md:** The generated documentation is committed as `README.md` to a specific folder in a GitHub repository.
   - **Upload Original JSON:** The original uploaded workflow file is also committed as `blueprint.json` in the same folder.

## Inputs

### Google Form

- **Form ID:** The workflow monitors responses from a specific Google Form (requires Form ID).
- **Expected Response Data:**
  - Response metadata (ID, submission times, respondent email).
  - Uploaded file(s): Workflow JSON files.

### Google Drive

- **File ID(s):** Retrieved from the uploaded files in Google Form responses.

### GitHub Repository

- **Repository credentials:** Requires a GitHub Personal Access Token to authorize commits to the target repository.
- **Target repository/folder:** Defines where each README and blueprint JSON will be uploaded, typically based on the workflow’s original filename.

---

## Outputs

- **GitHub Repository Update:**
  - A new or updated folder for each workflow containing:
    - `README.md`: Autogenerated summary of the workflow.
    - `blueprint.json`: The original, unmodified workflow JSON uploaded by the user.

---

## Integration Summary

- **Google Forms:** Collect submissions and files.
- **Google Drive:** Access and download uploaded files.
- **OpenAI GPT-4:** Generate high-level documentation from workflow JSON.
- **GitHub:** Archive both the original workflow and its documentation for each submission.

---

## Requirements

- **Google account** with access to the target Form and Drive.
- **OpenAI API access** for GPT-4 processing.
- **GitHub repository** with write access and a Personal Access Token.
- **Configured connections** for Google and OpenAI in the automation platform.

---

## Example Use Case

- **Internal automation archives:** Teams submit new workflow blueprints via a standardized Google Form. The process ensures every workflow is not only stored but also documented and accessible for collaborators via GitHub.

---

## Notes

- This automation assumes a consistent naming structure for uploaded files and expects valid workflow JSON.
- GitHub API tokens must be kept secure.
- The workflow can be adapted for other forms or repositories with minimal configuration changes.
