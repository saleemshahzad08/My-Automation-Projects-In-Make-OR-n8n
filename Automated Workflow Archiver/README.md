# Automated Workflow Archiver

## Overview

**Automated Workflow Archiver** is a Make (Integromat) automation designed to streamline the collection, analysis, and archival of workflow blueprints and their documentation. It integrates Google Forms, Google Drive, OpenAI, and GitHub to automatically:

1. **Collect** workflow JSON files via Google Form submissions.
2. **Download** the uploaded workflow files from Google Drive.
3. **Analyze** each workflow's structure using OpenAI to generate a human-readable README.
4. **Archive** both the original workflow JSON and its autogenerated README to a specified GitHub repository.

---

## Purpose

This workflow is intended for teams or individuals who collect workflows (e.g., Make/n8n blueprints) via form submissions and seek to automatically document and organize them in a GitHub repository for version control and collaboration.

---

## Workflow Steps

1. **Monitor Google Form Submissions**  
   Watches for new responses to a specific Google Form where users upload workflow JSON files.

2. **Fetch Uploaded Files from Google Drive**  
   Downloads JSON files submitted via the form's file upload field.

3. **Analyze Workflow (OpenAI GPT-4)**  
   Sends the JSON file to OpenAI GPT-4, requesting a concise README summarizing the workflow's purpose, inputs, and outputs.

4. **Save to GitHub**  
   - Option 1: Saves the generated README as a `README.md` in the appropriate repository folder.
   - Option 2: Saves the original workflow JSON (`blueprint.json`) to the same folder.

---

## Inputs

- **Google Form**:  
  - Link to the form where users submit their workflow files.
  - Collects:
    - Respondent email
    - Answer fields (including workflow file upload)

- **Google Drive**:  
  - Receives uploaded JSON files from the Google Form.
  - Requires permissions to read uploaded files.

- **OpenAI API**:  
  - Processes the workflow JSON to generate documentation.
  - Requires an OpenAI API connection.

- **GitHub Repository**:  
  - Destination for archiving each workflow and its README.
  - Requires a personal access token (PAT) with push permissions.

**Configuration Parameters:**
- Google Form ID 
- Google Connections (for Forms and Drive)
- OpenAI Connection (for GPT-4)
- GitHub Repo Info and PAT

---

## Outputs

- **GitHub Repository Folder:**
  - `/[Workflow Name]/blueprint.json`: The original workflow file as uploaded.
  - `/[Workflow Name]/README.md`: An AI-generated, human-friendly summary of the workflow.

## Example Use Case

Suppose you run a community or internal challenge where users upload Make or n8n workflows via a Google Form. This automation ensures every submission is instantly:

- Downloaded from Google Drive
- Documented with a summary (README)
- Archived to your GitHub repository for easy access and versioning

No manual steps required.

---

## Requirements

- Active Make (Integromat) account
- Access to Google Form and Google Drive APIs
- OpenAI API key (GPT-4 access)
- GitHub account with a repository and access token

---

## Limitations

- Only processes the latest 5 responses per execution (default, can be changed via the `limit` parameter).
- Uploads require valid credentials and permissions for Google Drive and GitHub.
- GitHub token (`YOUR_PAT`) must be replaced with a real Personal Access Token.

---

## Customization

- **Form ID and Field Mapping**: Adjust the Google Form ID and answer field mapping to match your own form.
- **GitHub Repository Path**: Modify the repository and folder structure as needed.
- **OpenAI Instructions**: You can update the prompt sent to OpenAI to generate README files in your preferred format or style.

---

## Security

- Keep all API keys and tokens secure.
- Ensure your Google and GitHub connections are fully authorized and scoped appropriately.
