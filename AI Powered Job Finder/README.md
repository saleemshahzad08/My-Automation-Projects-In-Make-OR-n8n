-   User job-search intake\
-   API-based job fetching\
-   AI-powered job summarization\
-   AI job-fit scoring (1--5)\
-   Automated HTML email digest generation\
-   Automated delivery of personalized job recommendations\
-   Automatic cleanup & reset of job execution data

This repository documents the complete architecture, API usage, workflow
logic, and technical details required for developers to understand,
maintain, extend, or deploy the system.
